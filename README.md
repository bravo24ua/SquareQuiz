Q2) Below is a link to a spreadsheet with two columns A and B such that:
A is the input
B is the output

Based on the spreadsheet, there exist a function such as  f that relates A to B which is:

Bi = f(Ai)
Where i is the row number of the spreadsheet.
For example:
	
For row i = 1: 				 f(15840) = cGp
For row i = 2:				f(16465) = cmW
For row i = 3:				f(17941) = cX3

Q2 a) First task is to find function f(Ai) using these sets of points in the spreadsheet.

Q2 b) Once the f(Ai) is found, what would be the output for the following inputs?
f(30001) = ?
f(55555) = ?
f(77788) = ?

Q2 c) What is the upper limit or maximum range of this function before there will be collisions or overflow? 

Q2 d) The first three parts are mostly mathematical and once you find the solution, you realize you need your programming skills to solve these questions completely. Therefore, please share any code that you write in the process of solving the above problems.

Hint 1: One must have a good idea about the domain and the range of the function f.
Hint 2: There are patterns within the spreadsheet that can help you find the function f.
